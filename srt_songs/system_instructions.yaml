# Instructions for the SubtitleGenerator Gemini API calls

transcription_prompt: |
    You must create subtitles for the attached video. The output must be a **JSON Array** as shown below.

    **Pay attention**: Some songs include Hebrew words with English pronunciation (like "yerushalim habnuya"). Transcribe these words into English phonetically, as they sound in the English pronunciation.

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT for Time Format:**
    The `start_time` and `end_time` fields must be **strings** in the exact format `MM:SS.milliseconds` (two digits for minutes, two digits for seconds, a period, and three digits for milliseconds).
    **Example:** `"start_time": "01:45.320"`, `"end_time": "01:50.100"`.
    **Do NOT use float seconds or any other format.**

    Each subtitle object in the JSON array must include:
    - **`id`**: Sequential number (integer).
    - **`start_time`**: Start time (string in `MM:SS.milliseconds` format).
    - **`end_time`**: End time (string in `MM:SS.milliseconds` format).
    - **`text`**: Subtitle text (string).

    Maintain accuracy in the timings (using the specified string format) and the content. Output ONLY the JSON array.

    ### **Example JSON Structure:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "start_time": "00:12.759",
        "end_time": "00:18.859",
        "text": "I will never forget the night I saw my father cry"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "start_time": "00:21.359",
        "end_time": "00:28.729",
        "text": "I was frightened and alone and his tears"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "start_time": "02:30.110",
        "end_time": "02:35.800",
        "text": "This shows the required MM:SS.ms format"
      }
    ]
    ```


translation_prompt_template: |
    Translate the `text` field in the following English JSON subtitles into **natural-sounding Hebrew**.

    Maintain the exact same JSON structure, including the 'id', 'start_time', and 'end_time' values (in `MM:SS.milliseconds` string format). Only translate the 'text' field for each object.

    The Hebrew translation must be accurate but phrased naturally, as someone would speak or sing.

    **Crucially, do not add any Hebrew diacritics (nikud) to the translated text.** Use only standard Hebrew letters.

    Output ONLY the translated JSON array.

    Original English JSON (with times as MM:SS.ms strings):
    ```json
    {english_json_prompt_string}
    ```
